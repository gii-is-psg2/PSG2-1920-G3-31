# --- COMMIT END ---
#
# Example:
#
#     fix(middleware): ensure Range headers adhere more closely to RFC 2616
#   
#     Add one new dependency, use `range-parser` (Express dependency) to compute
#     range. It is more well-tested in the wild.
#   
#     Fixes #2310

# The first line cannot be longer than 70 characters, 
# the second line is always blank and other lines should be wrapped at 80 characters.
# The type and scope should always be lowercase as shown below.
#
# Type can be
#    feat     (new feature)
#    fix      (bug fix)
#    refactor (refactoring production code, eg. renaming a variable)
#    style    (formatting, missing semi colons, etc; no code change)
#    docs     (changes to documentation)
#    test     (adding missing tests, refactoring tests; no production code change)
#    chore    (updating grunt tasks etc; no production code change)
#
# --------------------
#
# Scope can be
#    init
#    runner
#    watcher
#    config
#    web-server
#    proxy
#    etc.
#
# The <scope> can be empty (e.g. if the change is a global or difficult to assign 
# to a single component), in which case the parentheses are omitted.
# In smaller projects such as Karma plugins, the <scope> is empty.
#
# --------------------
#
# All breaking changes have to be mentioned in footer with the description of the change, justification and migration notes.
#
# Example:
#
#     BREAKING CHANGE:
#     
#     `port-runner` command line option has changed to `runner-port`, so that it is
#     consistent with the configuration file syntax.
#     
#     To migrate your project, change all the commands, where you use `--port-runner`
#     to `--runner-port`.
#
# Remember to:
#   * Use the imperative mood in the subject line
#   * Do not end the subject line with a period
#   * Separate subject from body with a blank line
#   * Use the body to explain what and why vs. how
#   * Comments won't appear in the commit
